## Problem Formulation

Binary classification:

*   Predict: `IsCancelled` or not:  y={0,1} with dim=2
*   Observations: processed feature set: X with dim=194

## Models

*   Deep Factorization-Machine (half-done)
*   Soft-Voting Ensemble Estimator
*   Neural Network (vanilla and tuned)
*   Random Forest (vanilla and tuned)
*   Decision Tree
*   XGBoost
*   AdaBoost
*   Extra Trees
*   SVM (vanilla and tuned)
*   Logistic Regression (baseline)
